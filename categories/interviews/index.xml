He is supervised by Véronique Dansereau and Jérôme Weiss at the National Center for Scientific Research in Grenoble, France.
&amp;quot; I hope my work will play its part and continue to be discussed, criticized, and explored. Véronique, Jérôme, and I are contributing to a promising path for the rheology community..&amp;quot;

She is supervised by Marc Bocquet at the Atmospheric Environment Teaching and Research Center (CEREA) and works closely with Alberto Carassi, WP4 PI leader. She will soon receive her PhD and join the Institute of Environmental Geosciences to continue her work on SASIP alongside Pierre Rampal and the other members of the SASIP team based in Grenoble, France.</description></item><item><title>Interview with Romain Caneill, Postdoc, CNRS</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/interview_romain_caneill/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/interview_romain_caneill/</guid><description>Romain Caneill, postdoc at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), recently joined SASIP to work on sea-ice rheology (WP2) and climate implications WP5. He accepted to share his scientific history, vision of science, motivations and hopes.
&amp;ldquo;I hope that at the end of the SASIP project, the ocean-atmosphere community will acknowledge the important role of sea ice and the fact that its dynamics need to be well represented in climate models.</description></item><item><title>Interview with Francesca Vittorioso, Postdoc, University of Bologna</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/interview_francesca/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/news/interview_francesca/</guid><description>Francesca Vittorioso, postdoc at the University of Bologna, Italy, recently joined SASIP to work on Data Assimilation. On February 21st, she will give a webinar (register here) presenting her latest research on the Contribution of the assimilation of MTG/IRS radiances for the characterisation of the atmospheric chemical composition over Europe. On this occasion, we asked her to share some of her personal and scientific history.
&amp;ldquo;SASIP will allow a better understanding of the warming of the polar regions.</description></item></channel></rss>
