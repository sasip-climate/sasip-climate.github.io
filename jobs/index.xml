Within SASIP project, the successful candidate will focus particularly on the sea ice dynamics simulated by the new neXtSIM-DG model, comparing it to both observations and other existing sea ice models (e.g. SI3 or neXtSIM in its Lagrangian version). In particular, the researcher will evaluate the realism of this dynamics including a new sub-mesh physics parameterization that takes into account ice floe dynamics (developed within SASIP by another team based in Grenoble), and will try to characterize its impact on oceanic or atmospheric boundary layers.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Job Offer in Grenoble, FR</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/isterre1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/isterre1/</guid><description>18-month post-doctoral researcher position in Grenoble, France on modelling mechanical interactions between waves and sea ice.
Within SASIP project, the successful candidate will focus particularly on (i) implementing new parameterizations in an existing large-scale coupled sea ice-ocean model, NeXtSIM, with the help of a research engineer (ii) validating the new parameterizations on the basis of comparisons with observations of ice deformation and drift (iii) adjusting, if necessary, the mechanical parameterizations according to the results of these comparisons and in the view of the specific needs of regional and global scales sea ice models.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Job Offer in Grenoble, FR</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/isterre2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/isterre2/</guid><description>24-month post-doctoral researcher position in Grenoble, France on mechanical sea ice modelling.
Within SASIP project, the successful candidate will focus particularly on formulating an equation for the evolution of the Floe Size Distribution (FSD) associated with wave-ice interactions that can be used in large-scale (10-100 km) continuous sea ice models
The researcher/post-doctoral fellow will a work in a group specialized in the mechanics of continuous media and of sea ice in particular, including engineers, PhD students and postdoctoral fellows.</description></item><item><title>SASIP Post-Doc Offer in Toulouse, FR</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/postdoc-ceci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/postdoc-ceci/</guid><description>We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest in ice-ocean and ice-atmosphere interactions to assess the climate relevance of integrating a newly developed sea ice model based on Brittle Bingham-Maxwell (BBM) rheology into a fully coupled climate model.
The postdoc will take advantage of the recent integration of the BBM rheology into SI3 (Brodeau et al. 2024), the sea ice component of the NEMO ocean model, to explore its advantages over the default Viscous-Plastic rheology of SI3.</description></item><item><title>Contact us for more job opportunities</title><link>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/contact-us/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sasip-climate.github.io/jobs/contact-us/</guid><description>You can reach out to office(at)sasip-climate.com</description></item></channel></rss>
