_[**Fig.7** (from Brodeau et al.)]([https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6051-2024]):Maps of the sea ice total deformation rate at the 10 km spatial and 3 d temporal scale for the period centered about 24 December 1996, computed based on (a) RGPS Lagrangian data and (b, c) their synthetic counterparts constructed using the simulated sea ice velocities of SI3-BBM and SI3-default, respectively. Empty regions correspond to the absence of satellite data during the period concerned_.
