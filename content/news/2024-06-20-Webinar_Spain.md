Tim Spain is a software developer from the NERSC who works on SASIP [**WP1**](https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-one/)

The nextSIM-DG sea ice model is at the core of the modelling in SASIP. It is derived from the existing Lagrangian nextSIM model (Rampal et al., 2016) and has been designed to be more flexible for both end users and coupling to other models. This webinar will cover what was necessary to go from the previous to the future version of model.
