This model owes its originality to the fact that it allows simulating ice floes of shapes derived from observations and collisions between these floes in a way that avoids unrealistic interpenetrations and the associated energy dissipation, which makes it a valuable tool for thermodynamic and eventually dynamic parameterization developments within the WP2 and WP3 of SASIP.
