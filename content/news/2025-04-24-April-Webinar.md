April webinar presented by Stéphane Labbé, Professor at Sorbonne Université (France) working on SASIP [**WP2**](https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-two/), and chaired by Pierre Rampal, SASIP Lead PI from CNRS (France).

Stéphane Labbé presents the latest enhancements developed for FloeDyn, a simulation software dedicated to the dynamics of granular sea ice. Several new features are either in development or already available. Focus is placed on floe faulting, a crucial process in sea ice rheology simulation, and the use of artificial intelligence for computation acceleration.
