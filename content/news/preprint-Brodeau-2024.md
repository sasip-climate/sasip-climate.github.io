In [**this new preprint**](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-231)published in Geoscientific Model Development, Laurent Brodeau, Pierre Rampal et al. describe how they achieved the numerical implementation of the Brittle Bingham-Maxwell sea-ice rheology (BBM) into SI3, the sea-ice component of NEMO

_[**Fig.7** (from Brodeau and Rampal)]([https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-231]):PDFs of the (a) shear, (b) divergence, (c) convergence, and (d) total deformation rates at the 10 km spatial and 3-day temporal scale, for RGPS data and their synthetic counterparts constructed using the simulated sea-ice velocities of SI3-BBM an SI3-aEVP. The light gray lines are for reference and correspond to a power-law with an exponent of -3. Below each panel, the departure between the logarithm of the simulated and observed distributions is shown for each bin_.
