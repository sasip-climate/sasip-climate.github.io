[**Data-driven surrogate modeling of high-resolution sea-ice thickness in the Arctic**](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1791-2024) by Charlotte Durand, Tobias Sebastian Finn, Alban Farchi, Marc Bocquet, Guillaume Boutin, and Einar Ólason published in the Cryosphere. 

In this article, Charlotte Durand et al. focus on predicting Arctic-wide sea-ice thickness using surrogate modeling with deep learning. The model has a predictive power of 12 h up to 6 months. For this forecast horizon, persistence and daily climatology are systematically outperformed, a result of learned thermodynamics and advection. Consequently, surrogate modeling with deep learning proves to be effective at capturing the complex behavior of sea ice.
