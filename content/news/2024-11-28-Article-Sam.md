_[**Fig.7** (from Brodeau et al.)](Open-water-mean (a)–(d) surface Stokes drift speed, and (e)–(h) turbulent Langmuir number from all simulations. Panels on the left (a–c and e–g) show results as a function of sea ice concentration for simulations with wind speeds (a), (e)  U = 5 m s−1 (b), (f) U = 10 m s−1, and (c), (g) U = 15 m s−1. Panels on the right (d), (h) show results as a function of mean fetch. Colors correspond to different FSDs, as indicated in the legend. Pale red lines show corresponding predictions from Appendix A (we omit uncertainty ranges for clarity). Dashed black lines in panels (e)–(h) designate mixing regimes (following Figure 11 in Q. Li et al., 2019).)._.
