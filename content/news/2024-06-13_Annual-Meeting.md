The 2024 SASIP annual meeting took place in Bologna, Italy, from June 4 to 6, 2024. Three days of inspiring talks and posters as well as productive working groups.

It was nice to see you all in person, thanks for joining!

This event gathered 60 participants of 7 countries (Italy, France, US, New Zealand, UK, Norway, Germany) from all the institutions of the SASIP consortium.

We will soon post here the recordings of the science talks and discussions. Keep posted!
