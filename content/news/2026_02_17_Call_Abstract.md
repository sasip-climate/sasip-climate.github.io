We invite submissions of abstracts to Session 16 of CMWR 2026 [Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources]([https://cmwrconference.org/]), to be held June 28 – July 2, 2026, in Bologna, Italy. The biennial CMWR Conference brings together researchers and practitioners working at the forefront of quantitative, data-integrated, and computational approaches in environmental and climate sciences. 

This session focuses on recent advances in **computational approaches for sea-ice modelling and prediction, bringing together developments in physics-based modelling, data assimilation, and machine learning**. Sea ice plays a critical role in the climate system, and improving its representation and predictability remains a major scientific and computational challenge. [See the description of the session]([https://cmwrconference.org/session-topics/]).

The session is linked to the international Scale Aware Sea Ice Project.

We welcome contributions from researchers, postdoctoral scholars, and practitioners in disciplines including (but not limited to):
Numerical methods for sea-ice dynamics and thermodynamics
Data assimilation techniques for sea ice, including satellite and in-situ observations
Machine-learning and hybrid physics–data approaches for modelling and forecasting
Predictive systems and evaluation of sea-ice forecasts across scales
Coupled ocean–ice–atmosphere modelling frameworks

**Abstract submission deadline: March 9, 2026**
Detailed information on abstract preparation and submission is available [here]([https://cmwrconference.org/registration-abstracts/])
