The 2023 VESRI midterm review meeting took place in Grenoble (02-03 October 2023). After 2 years since the beginning of SASIP, it was time to gather with SASIP and Shmidt Futures team members for the midterm review meeting ! 

We were extremely pleased to welcome about 35 participants of 7 countries (France, Germany, UK, Italy, Norway, US, New Zealand) from the institutions of the SASIP consortium, as well as reviewers and Schmidt Futures team members.

Thank you to all the participants for these ever more passionated science talks and discussions ! 

Always a pleasure to see each other in person !
